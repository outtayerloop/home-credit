=================== ==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Random forest       supervised machine learning algorithm that is constructed from decision tree algorithms
XGboost             optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable
Gradient boosting   method standing out for its prediction speed and accuracy, particularly with large and complex datasets. From Kaggle competitions to machine learning solutions for business, this algorithm has produced the best results
