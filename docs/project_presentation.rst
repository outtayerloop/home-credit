Project presentation
====================

Home-credit is an application aims to:
    - Create and validate 3 Machine learning models (XGboost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
        - **Data preparation**: collect and clean data, which is split into 2 CSV files, ```application_train.csv``` and ```application_test.csv```
        - **Model fit and validation** : using metrics such as accuracy score, F score, ROC Curve and confusion matrix
        - **Class prediction** : 0 or 1 (0 = repayed correctly, 1 = not repayed)

    - Provide client repayment abilities prediction, by selection one of the 3 Machine Learning models trained before

Algorithm Name       Aim
=================== ==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Random forest       Supervised machine learning algorithm that is constructed from decision tree algorithms
XGboost             Optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable
Gradient boosting   Method standing out for its prediction speed and accuracy, particularly with large and complex datasets. From Kaggle competitions to machine learning solutions for business, this algorithm has produced the best results
